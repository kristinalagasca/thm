# Linux Fundamentals
## A Bit of Background on Linux
Linux is a command line operating system based on unix. The first release of the Linux operating system occurred in 1991. There are multiple operating systems that are based on Linux. It is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX. Because UNIX is open-source, there are various flavors of Linux which each suit best for what the system is being used for. Ubuntu & Debian, for example, are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. Ubuntu can be run as a server for websites/web applications or it can be used as a fully-fledged desktop.
